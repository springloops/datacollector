 <title>Disconnected Mode</title>
 <shortdesc>After a <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> is
        registered with <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>, the
            <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        communicates with <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/> at
        regular intervals - around every 30 seconds or less. If a <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> cannot
        connect to <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>, due to
        a network or system outage, then the <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> uses
        the <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
        disconnected mode.</shortdesc>

                    mode</indexterm></indexterm>In disconnected mode, you can still log into and use
                <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            />. However, you cannot publish pipelines to <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>,
            view pipeline commit history, or download published pipelines from <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>.
            When the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            can connect to <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            again, it switches back to the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            enabled mode - and then you can continue to manage how pipelines work with <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"
            />.</p>
        <p>If a <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            /> switches to disconnected mode while you are logged in, <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            requires that you log in again with your <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            user account. After you log in, the following Disconnected Mode icon displays:</p>
