                    databases</indexterm></indexterm>The Geo IP processor is a lookup processor that
            can return geolocation and IP intelligence information for a specified IP address.</p>
        <p>The Geo IP processor uses MaxMind GeoIP2 database files for the lookup. You must provide
            your own copy of the database files. </p>
        <note type="tip">MaxMind provides some free databases that you can use.</note>
        <p>To use the Geo IP processor, you specify the location of the database files and the
            database types that you want to use. You enter one or more IP address input fields, name
            the corresponding output field, and specify the return  information that you want. You
            can also configure the action that the processor takes if the database files do not have
            an IP address.</p>
    <p>The input field must be an Integer or String data type that passes IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.</p>
