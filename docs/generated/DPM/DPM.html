 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">StreamSets <span class="ph">Dataflow Performance Manager</span><sup class="ph sup">TM</sup> (<span class="ph">DPM</span>) is a
        management console for data in motion. <span class="ph">DPM</span> lets
        you map, measure, and master complex dataflows within your organization. With <span class="ph">DPM</span>, you
        can map multiple dataflows in a single visual topology and track changes to the dataflows
        over time. You can view real-time statistics to measure the performance and quality of your

        <p class="p">Multiple types of users within
            your organization can perform different roles in <span class="ph">DPM</span>.
            For example, a data architect typically creates a high-level design of how data needs to
            flow through multiple systems. A data engineer uses this high-level design to develop
            individual pipelines in a development <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>.
            The data engineer then publishes the finished pipelines to <span class="ph">DPM</span>. A
            DevOps or site reliability engineer adds published pipelines to jobs and then runs the
            jobs across multiple <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s.
            Data architects map the related jobs into a single visual topology, and then use the
            topology to monitor and measure the complete dataflow.</p>

        <p class="p">Let’s take a closer look at what data architects, data engineers, and DevOps engineers
            can accomplish with <span class="ph">DPM</span>.</p>

    </div>

<div class="related-links"></div>
<div class="topic concept nested1" id="concept_knb_cjq_dx">
 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Design the Complete Data Architecture</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">As a data architect - the person responsible for defining how data is stored, consumed,
        and managed by different systems - you design the complete flow of data through multiple
        systems. You might architect the high-level design in a design document or diagram. Then,
        you work with your team to develop <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
        pipelines that meet those dataflow needs.</p>

  <p class="p">For example, you need to create a
            360-degree view of your customers by collecting all customer data captured in your
            organization’s social feeds, enterprise data warehouse, and website logs. You need to
            send all of the data to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for further analysis
            using tools such as Hive and Impala. You determine that the website logs must be written
            to Kafka as an intermediary system before being streamed to HDFS. </p>

        <p class="p">To address this need, you create the following high-level design of the complete data
            flow:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_knb_cjq_dx__image_w1d_k5r_dx" src="../Graphics/DPM_DesignArchitecture.png" height="266" width="644"></img></p>

        <p class="p">Then the rest of your team uses this high-level design to develop the necessary
            pipelines, jobs, and topologies within <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            and <span class="ph">DPM</span>.</p>

<div class="topic concept nested1" id="concept_ung_wbs_bx">
 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Manage the Pipeline Repository</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">As a data engineer - the person responsible for making sure that data flows smoothly
        between systems - you use a development <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
        instance to develop the pipelines needed to implement the designed data architecture. When
        the pipelines are complete, you publish the pipelines to the pipeline repository in <span class="ph">DPM</span>. </p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">DPM</span>
            provides release management of pipelines. A typical pipeline development cycle involves
            iterative changes to the pipeline. <span class="ph">DPM</span>
            maintains the version history of each published pipeline. For example, as you design the
            Social Feeds Dataflows pipeline, you test the pipeline and then make changes to it. As a
            result, you will likely publish the pipeline to the <span class="ph">DPM</span>
            pipeline repository multiple times, as displayed in the following image of the pipeline
            history: </p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_ung_wbs_bx__image_llt_s4t_bx" src="../Graphics/DPM_ManagePipelineRepository.png" height="209" width="505"></img></p>

        <p class="p">When viewing the pipeline history in <span class="ph">DPM</span>,
            you can view the configuration details for any pipeline version and can compare pipeline
            versions side-by-side. For example, if we click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Compare with Previous
                Version</span> icon <img class="image" id="concept_ung_wbs_bx__image_zqv_3st_bx" src="../Graphics/icon_DPM_ComparePreviousVersion.png" height="18" width="18"></img> for version 3 in the image above, <span class="ph">DPM</span>
            displays version 2 and version 3 in the comparison window as follows: </p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_ung_wbs_bx__image_bzq_3d5_bx" src="../Graphics/DPM_ComparePipelineVersions.png" height="252" width="629"></img></p>

        <p class="p">We can see that version 3 of the pipeline added an Expression Evaluator processor. We can
            drill into the details of each pipeline stage, and compare the configuration of each
            stage between the versions.</p>

        <p class="p">You can add tags to pipeline versions to mark release points or to separate development
            and production environments. For example, when you finish developing the Social Feeds
            Dataflows pipeline, you add a "Ready to Deploy" tag to the latest version. That tag
            informs your DevOps engineer which pipeline version is ready to be added to a job and
            run.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Manage the Orchestration of Running Jobs</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In <span class="ph">DPM</span>,
        pipelines are the design of the dataflow. Jobs are the execution of the
        dataflow.</p>

        <p class="p">As a DevOps or site reliability
            engineer - the person responsible for ensuring that all services and systems are
            scalable and reliable - you create <span class="ph">DPM</span>
            jobs to run pipelines and to determine the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s
            that run the jobs. When you run a job on a group of <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s,
                <span class="ph">DPM</span>
            remotely runs the pipeline on all <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s
            in the group. This enables you to manage and orchestrate large scale dataflow jobs run
            across multiple <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s.</p>

        <p class="p">You might organize jobs by project, geographic region, or department. For example, your
            data engineer has developed and published the WebLog Collection pipeline and the EDW
            Replication Flows pipeline. In your data center, you designate <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s
            that run on several of the servers as the web server group. You designate another group
            of <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s running on other servers as the data warehouse group. You then create a job to run
            the WebLog Collection pipeline on the group of web server <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s. </p>

        <p class="p">The following image displays how the WebLog Collection job runs a remote pipeline
            instance on each <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> in
            the web server group. The job does not run on <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s
            in the data warehouse group, which are <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s
            that are reserved for jobs that read from the enterprise data warehouse.</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_inh_ccs_bx__image_dtc_h21_cx" src="../Graphics/DPM_ManageOrchestration.png" height="189" width="544"></img></p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Map Jobs into a Topology</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>, you can monitor and view the details of a single pipeline. However, you typically run
        multiple intermediary pipelines, all of which work together to create a complete
        dataflow.</p>

        <p class="p">As a data architect, you create a
            topology in <span class="ph">DPM</span> to
            map multiple related jobs into a single view. A topology provides interactive end-to-end
            views of data as it traverses multiple pipelines.</p>

        <p class="p">To continue our Customer 360 example, after the WebLog Collection pipeline reads web
            server log files and writes the data to Kafka, another pipeline consumes the Kafka data,
            processes it, and streams the data to HDFS. Additional pipelines read from Twitter
            social feeds and from an enterprise data warehouse and also write the data to HDFS. In
                <span class="ph">DPM</span>, you can create a topology that includes jobs for all the pipelines, as follows: </p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_t34_2ds_bx__image_um3_nk1_cx" src="../Graphics/DPM_MapPipelinesTopology.png" height="430" width="622"></img></p>

        <p class="p">From the topology, you can select each job and then drill into the configuration details
            of each pipeline. You can add any number of jobs to a topology.</p>

<div class="topic concept nested1" id="concept_sx5_zds_bx">
 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Measure Dataflow Quality</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph">DPM</span>
        provides the same level of detailed monitoring for topologies and jobs that you are
        accustomed to seeing for pipelines within <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>. </p>

        <p class="p">As a data architect, you can
            measure the health of the topology and the performance of all jobs and connecting
            systems included in the topology. <span class="ph">DPM</span>
            monitoring provides real-time statistics, error information, and alerts about the
            running jobs. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, the Summary tab of the Customer 360 topology provides a single view into the
            record count and throughput for all running jobs in the topology:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_sx5_zds_bx__image_hv1_ctq_fx" src="../Graphics/DPM_MeasureQualityTopology.png" height="487" width="744"></img></p>

        <p class="p">You can select a job or a connecting system within the topology to discover more detailed
            monitoring about the job or system. </p>

        <p class="p">When a job runs on a group of <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s,
                <span class="ph">DPM</span>
            provides a single view of the statistics for the complete job. From a job, you can view
            the statistics for a single pipeline or you can view the aggregated statistics across
            all remote pipeline instances that are run on a group of <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>s.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, if we select the Social Feeds Dataflows job in the topology, the Summary tab
            displays metrics for the selected job:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_sx5_zds_bx__image_ylz_ptq_fx" src="../Graphics/DPM_MeasureQualityJob.png" height="536" width="748"></img></p>

        <p class="p">We've seen how you can use DPM to turn a high-level architecture diagram of your
            dataflows into pipelines and jobs that you can then manage and measure from a single
            topology. Give it a try, and see for yourself how easy DPM has made it to map, measure,
            and master your data in motion.</p>
